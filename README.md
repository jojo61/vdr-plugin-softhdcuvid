A software and GPU emulated UHD output device plugin for VDR.

    o Video decoder CPU / VDPAU
    o Video output opengl
    o Audio FFMpeg / Alsa / Analog
    o Audio FFMpeg / Alsa / Digital
    o Audio FFMpeg / OSS / Analog
    o HDMI/SPDIF pass-through
    o Software volume, compression, normalize and channel resample
    o VDR ScaleVideo API
    o CUDA deinterlacer
    o Autocrop
    o Suspend / Dettach
    o PIP (Picture-in-Picture) (not working yet)


To compile you must have the 'requires' installed.


This is a fork of johns original softhddevice work and I reworked it to support HEVC with CUDA and opengl output.
Currently I have tested it with a GTX 1050 from NVIDIA. SD, HD and UHD is working.

Current Status NVIDIA:
The CUDA driver supports HEVC with 8 Bit and 10 Bit up to UHD resolution. Opengl is able to output also 10 Bit, but NVIDIA does not support to output 10 Bit via HDMI.
Only via DisplayPort you can get 10 Bit output to a compatible screen. This is a restriction from NVIDIA.

Current Status with VAAPI
You need libplacebo.
It is still beta and I tested it with Intel VAAPI. If you have problmes with the shaders then copy the drirc file in your home directory as .drirc
AMD VAAPI is broken by AMD and will not work currently. The vaapi_deinterlace is broken and the amdgpu driver is instable. I have not testet with amdgpupro

You have to adapt the Makefile to your needs. I use FFMPEG 4.0
The Makefile expects the CUDA SDK in /usr/local/cuda. Currently it is tested with CUDA 10

Unfortunatly older FFMEGs has a bug with deinterlacing cuda frames. Best to get the latest FFMPEG Version.

Otherwise  you have to patch the file in libavcodec/cuviddec.c
Somewhere near line 860 and 1066 depending on your release:
old:
     ctx->frame_queue = av_fifo_alloc(ctx->nb_surfaces * sizeof(CuvidParsedFrame));

new:
     ctx->frame_queue = av_fifo_alloc((ctx->nb_surfaces + 2 ) * sizeof(CuvidParsedFrame));

This Version supports building with libplacebo. https://github.com/haasn/libplacebo
You have to enable it in the Makefile and install libplacebo yourself.
At the moment this is Work in progress.
It also needs the NVIDIA driver 410.48 or newer as well as CUDA 10.

Also you can enable a Scaler Test feature. When enabled then the screen is split.On the left half you will see the scaler defined by Scaler Test and on the right side you will see the scaler defined at the Resolution setting. There is as small black line between the halfs to remaind you that Scaler Test is activ.

If your FFMEG supports it then you can enable YADIF in the Makefile and select btween the buildin NVIDIA CUDA deinterlacer and the YADIF cuda deinterlacer.

Good luck

Quickstart:
-----------

Just type make and use.

Install:
--------
	1a) git

	git clone git://github.com/jojo61/vdr-plugin-softhdcuvid.git
	cd vdr-plugin-softhdcuvid
	make
	make install

	You can edit Makefile to enable/disable  Alsa / OSS
	support.  The default is to autodetect as much as possible.

	You have to start vdr with -P 'softhdcuvid -d :0.0  ..<more option>.. '
