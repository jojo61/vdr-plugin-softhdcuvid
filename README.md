A software and GPU emulated UHD output device plugin for VDR.

    o Video decoder CUVID or VAAPI
    o Video output opengl or DRM
    o Audio FFMpeg / ALSA / Analog
    o Audio FFMpeg / ALSA / Digital
    o HDMI/SPDIF pass-through
    o Software volume, compression, normalize and channel resample
    o VDR ScaleVideo API
    o CUDA deinterlacer
    o Suspend / Detach
    o Support for ambilight
    o Support for Screencopy
    o PIP (Picture-in-Picture) (only for CUVID)




This is a fork of johns original softhddevice work and I reworked it to support HEVC with CUDA and opengl output.
Currently I have tested it with a GTX 1050 from NVIDIA. SD, HD and UHD is working.

Current Status NVIDIA:
The CUDA driver supports HEVC with 8 Bit and 10 Bit up to UHD resolution. Opengl is able to output also 10 Bit, but NVIDIA does not support to output 10 Bit via HDMI.
Only via DisplayPort you can get 10 Bit output to a compatible screen. This is a restriction from NVIDIA.

Current Status with VAAPI:
I tested it with Intel VAAPI. If you have problmes with the shaders then copy the drirc file in your home directory as .drirc
AMD VAAPI is broken by AMD and will not work currently.

You have to adapt the Makefile to your needs. I use FFMPEG 4.0

This Version supports building with libplacebo. https://github.com/haasn/libplacebo
You have to enable it in the Makefile and install libplacebo yourself.

It also needs the NVIDIA driver 410.48 or newer as well as CUDA 10.

I recommend to use libplacebo. It has much better scaler and does colorconversion for HDR the correct way.

If your FFMEG supports it then you can enable YADIF in the Makefile and select between the buildin NVIDIA CUDA deinterlacer and the YADIF cuda deinterlacer.

Good luck

Quickstart:
-----------

You have to adapt the Makefile. There are 3 possible Version that you can build:

    softhdcuvid  (CUVID=1)
    This is for NVIDA cards and uses cuvid as decoder. It uses xcb for output and needs a X Server to run.
    I recommend to use libplacebo and set LIBPLACEBO=1 in the Makefile

    softhdvaapi (VAAPI=1)
    This is for INTEL cards and uses Vaapi as decoder. It uses xcb for output and needs a X Server to run.
    I recommend to use libplacebo and set LIBPLACEBO=1 in the Makefile. Also LIBPLACEBO_GL is supportet here.

    softhddrm (DRM=1)
    This is for INTEL cards and also uses Vaapi as decoder. It uses the DRM API for output and
    runs without X Server. There are several commandline options to select the resolution and refresh rate.
    I recommend to use libplacebo and set LIBPLACEBO_GL=1 in the Makefile.



Install:
--------
	1a) git

	git clone git://github.com/jojo61/vdr-plugin-softhdcuvid.git
	cd vdr-plugin-softhdcuvid
	make
	make install

	You have to start vdr with -P 'softhdcuvid -d :0.0  ..<more option>.. '

Beginners Guide for libplacebo:
-------------------------------
    When using libplacebo you will find several config options.

    First of all you need to set the right scaler for each resolution:
    Best you begin with setting all to "bilinear". If that works ok for you, you can try to change them
    for more advanced scaler. I use ewa_robidouxsharp on my GTX1050, but your mileage may vary.
    Unfortunatly on INTEL not all scalers may work or crash.
    The Intel GPU is much slower than NVIDIA and for UHD you most likly need to set the scaler to bilinear.

    You can enable a Scaler Test feature. When enabled then the screen is split.On the left half you will
    see the scaler defined by Scaler Test and on the right side you will see the scaler defined at the
    Resolution setting. There is as small black line between the halfs to remaind you that Scaler Test
    is activ.

    Then you should set the Monitor Type to "sRGB". This guarantees you the best colors on your screen.
    At the moment all calculations internaly are done in RGB space and all cards output also RGB.
    If you use the softhddrm Version then you should set the Monitor Type to HD TV or UHD-HDR TV if you have
    connected one of those.

    If you are colorblind you could try to remedy this with the Colorblind Settings. Realy only needed
    in rare cases.

    All other settings can be in their default state.

	Note for NUC11/12 Users:
	Provide paramete -w alsa-no-test to get Audio working.

    Beginning with libplacebo API 58 user shaders from mpv are supported. Use -S parameter to set the shader.
    The plugins searches the shaders in $ConfigDir/plugins/shaders for the shaders. One example shader is
    provided in the shader subdirectory. Copy it to e.g.: /etc/vdr/plugins/shaders and then start
    vdr -P 'softhdcuvid -S filmgrain.glsl ...'
    I use KrigBilateral for UV scaling and then adaptive-sharpen for sharpening. This results in a perfect
    picture for me.

    You can also use a custon LUT File. It is located in $ConfigDir/shaders/lut/lut.cube. If you provide there
    a lut file it will be automaticly used. In the Mainmenue you can switch LUT on and off.

Konfig Guide for softhddrm Version
----------------------------------
    You should set the Monitor Type to HD TV or UHD-HDR TV depending on your TV Set
    With softhddrm and a HDR TV Set you can view HDR-HLG content. This is tested with Kernel 5.12 and a Intel NUC.
